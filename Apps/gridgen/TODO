* on MOM4Grid fix() method, close the south pole and the vertical hole.
    - Related to this one: I am accessing x_vert_T variable to calculate position
      of the click, but using x_vert_T[0] (fixed with north poles closed) to plot.
      Rewrite to use only the new one, after fixing the other dimensions.
* depending on zoom level choose different resolutions for continent boundaries.
    DONE: but it is slow. Change Basemap to only read boundaries that are shown?
    Hmm...
* queue events, so we can have a more responsive UI? Hmmm...
* Do I need to convert the matrix when the zoom doesn't change? Probably yes,
  but it is a good optimization to look after when I get enough time.
* zoom should work with wid/height and lat/lon too, not only with crnrx/crnry
* Rethink zoom level, with fine res grids the cells are too small at max zoom.
