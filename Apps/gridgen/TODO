* on MOM4Grid fix() method, close the south pole and the vertical hole.
* depending on zoom level choose different resolutions for continent boundaries.
    DONE: but it is slow. Change Basemap to only read boundaries that are shown?
    Hmm...
* queue events, so we can have a more responsive UI? Hmmm...
* Do I need to convert the matrix when the zoom doesn't change? Probably yes,
  but it is a good optimization to look after when I get enough time.
* zoom should work with wid/height and lat/lon too, not only with crnrx/crnry
